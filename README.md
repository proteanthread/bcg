# David Ahl's BASIC Computer Games

## These haven't been tested, validated, debugged, or verified!
### Use at your own risk:

* Yes, I used Google Anti-Gravity to convert the programs from GW-BASIC to 'C', but what a better learning tool than to debug a program?

* This repository contains a 'C' port of the classic GW-BASIC games from **David Ahl's "BASIC Computer Games"** and **"More BASIC Computer Games"** originally published by Creative Computing.

* The original games were written in GW-BASIC and have been ported over to 'C', ensuring they compile and run on a variety of platforms including Linux (GCC), Windows (MSVC), and FreeDOS (Open Watcom).

* When I get time, I will finish this project, otherwise fork it and finish it yourself.

* Make sure CAPS LOCK IS ON!

## Background & History

## Build Instructions

The repository includes build scripts for multiple environments:

* **Linux (GCC)**: Run `./build_lx.sh`
* **Windows 11 (MSVC)**: Run `build_win.bat`
* **FreeDOS (Watcom)**: Run `build_fd.bat`

The source files for the C ports are located in the `src/` directory. The original GW-BASIC code is retained in the `.bas` files in the root directory and as comments directly inside the ported `.c` source files for easy reference.
